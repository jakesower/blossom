# Utils

These are utility functions used throughout the project. I wrote them, which means that many of them can be significantly improved. PRs welcome.

## Philosophy

I want well defined utility functions. That means that they always take in the same arguments and act on them. That means no optional arguments, no "if argument X is a string, do one thing, if it's an array to something else." Predictability over versitility.
